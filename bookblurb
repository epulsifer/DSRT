The Arizona/Nevada desert is a mysterious place. Secrets get uncovered all the time â€¦ like, say, bodies.

When that happens, other forces try to cover the evidence.

It takes a pair of misfit reporters and two casino employees to dig it right back up again.

What they find puts everyone in danger.

Riverbend, Arizona sits across the Colorado River across from Sagebrush, a Nevada town with a casino and not much else. The side-by-side towns were founded and grew from a rivalry between two families that grows deadly.

It's up to reporters Alfredo "Fred" Walker and Richard Lawrence to sort through the bodies. Walker is a hard-drinking Tex-Mex with four ex-wives and a lot of baggage, and the Tennessee-bred Lawrence brings tons of talent and a lot of attitude to the investigation. Blackjack dealer Diana Cook and her cocktail waitress friend Beth Rodgers join the investigation, putting themselves in danger as they help the reporters find answers.
